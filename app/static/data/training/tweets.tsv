pos	@ekathimerini Far Left has used and uses Tsipras as a wheelbarrow to the microphones, as #Tsipras used #ND and #PASOK before January 25.
pos	Like Tsipras, Merkel has rebels in the party but fans in the country.  https://t.co/RkIz28lzkC
pos	Tsipras resigns like a martyr. Blames Troika for driving Greece to the edge. But it is Tsipras that may have pushed Greece over it.

pos	Tsipras: Varoufakis gave talks momentum at start but then stopped. Says he saw Lagarde, others "switch off" when V spoke on Jun 25 #Greece
pos	4 Of course, Tsipras may not need these 3 parties. He may get overall majority (unlikely) or be able to rule with ANEL (not very likely)
pos	@Reuters The snap election will be on 20 September while the opposition groups such as Lafazanis led Popular unity or ND accused Tsipras
neg	It would be a strategic mistake of the 1st order 4 Tsipras (let alone a genuine anti-austerity politician) to seek and maintain a leading ..

pos	Zlatan is looking mighty attractive at the moment,if LVG doesn't get a striker by Tuesday, I really don't fancy us scoring goals this season
pos	Wonder if Zlatan will be a United player come Tuesday night, think he may be the only realistic option of a big name signing.
neg	Today United should have done better, the referee didn't help at all!!!!  Rooney to 10 pls! Just sign Zlatan tomorrow pleeeeeeze
neg	If there is a silver lining this shows LVG if we dont buy anyone b4 Tuesday we is fucked!! Fuck it i would take Zlatan!!
pos	If Wenger is in Paris. Could it be for Cavani or Zlatan?Then again he may be on a family break.
pos	Ok ed let's do this, Zlatan, greizmann and Laporte tomorrow make it happen
pos	Goal level: Zlatan  90k by Friday? = Posting every other day  #DSGS (Vine by @ElexAuerbach) https://t.co/BPUM3A8tSD
pos	@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price
pos	Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC
pos	Noooooo! I was hoping to see Zlatan being Zlatan in Tuesday! Oh well, still looking forward to the match.  https://t.co/swGyd9cQAJ
