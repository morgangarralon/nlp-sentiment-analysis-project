pos	Goal level: Zlatan  90k by Friday? = Posting every other day  #DSGS (Vine by @ElexAuerbach) https://t.co/BPUM3A8tSD
pos	@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price
pos	Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC
pos	Noooooo! I was hoping to see Zlatan being Zlatan in Tuesday! Oh well, still looking forward to the match.  https://t.co/swGyd9cQAJ
